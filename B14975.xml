            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Of the last thirty waggons, which were going from Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford towards Collen, the Weymarish have not onely taken away all the goods, but also killed almost all the convoy and wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goners,

                  <p>Gen: Bannier hath a very bad march in his comming back from Bohemia, and in these deep wayes he was faine to put before divers wagons loaden with baggage, 16. and more horses, and before divers peeces of ordnance, he was faine to put from 60. to 70. horses, yet they were not able to draw them through the mire, wherefore Gen: Bannier was forced to put his owne horses before the Canons, and hath cōman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from 5. to 800. musquetiers to draw together with the horses and to get them forward: On wednesday last General Bannier had his head quarter at Qwickaw, and at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent he lyes about Altenburg, by al appearance, he wil march through Misnia,, and come to this Citie and pitch his Campe here abouts, to which end divers of his Officers as also his own Nephew are arrived heere with 400. horse men and divers other troopes are to follow them, on th'other side the Imperiall General Piccolomini followeth likewise close, who kept on Sunday last his Randevouz at Annaberg, but he hath onely his horse men about him, &amp; the foot forces together with Arch-Duke Leopold William and the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie follow as fast as they can, which puts these Countries into great terrour, every one in the Countrie must bring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently the halfe part of his provision into the Magazin, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that Gen: Banniers comming into these parts progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticates, that he will draw the Weymarish forces unto him, &amp; if they doe not come unto him it is thought, that hee will passe againe the River of Elve and goe towards Lusatia, to which end Colon: Coningsmarck hath about him some 100.

The Electour of Brandenburg his troope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie yet about Tangermunde, which are not yet passed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Elve, the reason is not knowne. The Duke of Lune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg makes great preparations to goe to field, who causeth his Campe about Northeim to be repaired, and in haste to be brought together 300. strong horses for the Artillerie, it is thought, that he intends, if any forces should come that way, to turne thē away betimes. In Prussia are likewislevied great forces for the King of Poland, Lievtenant General Baudissen hath likewise taken service under the said King. The King of Denmarck his forces lie yet in and about Pinneberg, many are of opinion, that some strange businesses will fall out that way, because the Count of Shaumburg is gone towards Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who as the report goes, hath taken service under the States.</p>
